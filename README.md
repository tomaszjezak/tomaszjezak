I'm Tomasz, an aspiring Machine Learning Engineer and Researcher. I graduated from UCLA with a B.S. in Applied Mathematics and will be starting a Software Engineer co-op position at Amazon Robotics.

I have completed several projects in both Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing, leveraging my extensive knowledge of mathematics and statistics, and developing strong skills in PyTorch and research methodologies.

I plan to begin graduate school in the fall of 2025.
