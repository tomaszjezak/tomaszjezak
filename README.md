I'm Tomasz, I'm finishing my undergrad at UCLA studying Applied Math and Computer Science. My work is focused on AI/ML research, specifically in Computer Vision and NLP. I have also recently been interested in explainability and applying my extensive knowledge of math and stats to AI. I am passionate about creating intelligent systems using AI.
