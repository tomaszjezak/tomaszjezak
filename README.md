I’m an engineer and grad student focusing on ML and Robotics at UC San Diego, in Henrik Christensen's Cognitive Robotics Laboratory.

Previously, I worked at Amazon Robotics on safety-critical human–robot interaction, building a large-scale multi-modal dataset and engineering an end-to-end ML pipeline. I also designed and implemented a ROS2-based multi-robot control framework (planning, coordination and navigation).

I’m passionate about building autonomous robotic systems that can perceive, learn, and act reliably in complex environments.
