I work at Amazon Robotics in the research lab of Dr. Yuri Ivanov. I'm researching a multimodal human detection system. I plan to begin graduate school in Fall 2025, working on robotics safety. I am especially interested in the fields of robotics under uncertainty and human-level perception. I graduated from UCLA with a B.S. in Applied Math in 2024.
