Iâ€™m a machine learning researcher and engineer pursuing my M.S. in Computer Science at UC San Diego, with a focus on ML for robotics, particularly world models, sensory learning, and multi-robot control.

Previously, I worked at Amazon Robotics on safety-critical humanâ€“robot interaction, building a large-scale multi-modal dataset and engineering an end-to-end ML pipeline. I also designed and implemented a ROS2-based multi-robot control framework for coordination and navigation.

Iâ€™m passionate about building intelligent, uncertainty-aware robotic systems that can perceive, learn, and act reliably in complex environments.
